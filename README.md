# 5AM.co

## About

This is a small 3 pages portfolio framework for Shawn S. Choi’s site 5AM.co. Shawn will be adding content in the future so I’ve stuck to HTML, Vanilla CSS, and a little Javascript for inline retina images, scalable video, and the hide/show mobile navigation. To save time, the site is being compiled on Jekyll to help with automating the permalink structure, page meta data, and links between project pages. The final deliverable for Shawn is the Jekyll `_site` directory.

## Compiling The _site Directory
1. Go to the bokchoi directory in Terminal on your Mac.
2. Run `jekyll build --watch` to watch for changes in the project files.
3. Run `jekyll serve` and go to `localhost:4000` in your browser of choice.

## Commiting to git
1. In the bokchoi directory, run `git status`.
2. All all the files that from the project using `git add --all`.
3. Commit your changes using `git -m "Your message here."`.
4. Pull and rebase your changes over the remote repository on Github using `git pull --rebase`.
5. Push your changes in your local repository to the remote repository on Github by running `git push`.
6. If you’re done for the day, close your laptop, grab a drink, and celebrate your freedom.
